Project:
    To create an interactive todo list

Tried to learn a few things with this, such as the animated menu and button,
showing the description when you hover over the todo and creating a filter function. I had been on a break from coding before coming back and doing this project. Overall I learned a lot and after this I was really pushed to better organise my code and improve on my CSS and design skills.
