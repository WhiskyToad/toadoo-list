Project:
    To create an interactive todo list

What I learned: 

I came back to complete the filter functionality after doing some more learning. All I've got to say is WOW, what a mess!!! It works as intended but I definately need to split my javascript modules up better and also improve my CSS skills (and split them up), both of which I did do in my most recent project, I learned a great deal doing this however.
